## Ownership vs Licensing

### First-Sale Doctrine
When you buy a physical object, you "own" that product. You have full rights to re-sell it, rent it, lend it, or give it away.

The new owner of that product has the same rights that you had on the object.

### Licensing and "Terms and Conditions"
When you "buy" a piece of software, you don't own the software. The copyright owner (aka the company) allows you to use the software under a set of license agreements *(You know, the Terms and Conditions page that you never read)*

There are many different types of licenses that companies can use with their software. Often they are in terms of users and devices.
- 1 user on 3 devices
- Up to 200 employees

With digital goods that are licensed, you no longer have the right to re-sell, lend, rent, or give away the software.
